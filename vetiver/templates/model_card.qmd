A [model card](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596) provides brief, transparent, responsible reporting for a trained machine learning model.

## Model details

- Developed by PERSON AND/OR TEAM
```{python}
#| echo: false
model_desc = v.description
num_features = len(v.prototype.construct().dict())

display(Markdown(f"""
- A {model_desc} using {num_features} feature{'s'[:num_features^1]}.
"""))
```

- More details about how model was developed and what it is predicting
- More details on feature engineering and/or data preprocessing for model

```{python}
#| echo: false
version = v_meta.version
time_created =  datetime.datetime\
    .strptime(v_meta.created, '%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ')\
    .strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

display(Markdown(f"""
- Version {version} was created at {time_created}
"""))

## compute predictions for your evaluation data
from vetiver.data import sacramento

sacramento["preds"] = v.model.predict(sacramento.drop(columns=["price"]))
metric_set = [metrics.mean_absolute_error, metrics.mean_squared_error, metrics.r2_score]

dmp
```

## Visualize model performance

```{python}
performance = px.scatter(sacramento, x="price", y = "preds", facet_row="type")
performance.update_yaxes(matches=None)
performance.show()
```

## Make a custom plot

```{python}
custom = px.violin(sacramento, x="beds", y = "price")
custom.show()
```
